# Project Description

wxLua is a Lua wrapper for the cross-platform [wxWidgets GUI library](https://www.wxwidgets.org/).
It allows developers to create applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Lua
and supports Lua 5.4, and LuaJIT.
Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets (and by extension wxlua)
gives applications a native look and feel as it uses the platform's native API
rather than emulating the GUI.

wxLua can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple, but useful
scripts (you can find a variety of examples in the [samples](wxLua/samples) directory)
to a fully functional IDE (like [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/)).

The library provides the ability to create complex user interface dialogs,
file and image manipulation, drawing, sockets, displaying HTML, printing, and many others.
You can use as much or as little of wxWidgets as you like and C++ developers can trim
down the size the bindings by turning off preprocessor directives.
